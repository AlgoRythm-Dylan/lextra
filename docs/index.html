	<h1>Lextra</h1>
	<p>
		Lextra (roughly meaning Lua extra libraries, Lua extra functionality, or even "a lil' extra")
		is a general-purpose Lua library with the main goal of making Lua a viable stand-alone
		programming language and adding to the Lua standard library to make programming in Lua
		just a bit quicker and easier.
	</p>
	<p>
		While there are big plans for this library, nothing's going to be implemented for sure except
		the things which have already been implemented. In other words, no promises.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lextra does not require you run a special version of Lua. Lextra is designed to be dynamically
		linked with the default Lua interpreter. However, lextra may offer precompiled binaries for
		convenience (Compiling Lua on Windows can be tricky). Lextra is either written in Lua directly
		or compiled to a dynamic library (.dll for windows and .so for linux) so that you can simply
		<span class="code">require</span> whatever library you desire. No installation, no hassle.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lextra has started on Lua 5.3 and does not have plans to be compatible with previous versions.
		Lextra may be compatible with them by accident, however. In addition, Lextra plans to keep up
		with the official releases of Lua the best it can, and will probably drop support for older
		versions of Lua the minute lextra is adapted to a newer version.
	</p>

	<p>
		While Lua's minimalist style is lost here, lextra still aims to be simple. Code is sectioned
		off into manageable modules, which almost always clearly define what they do in their name.
		If you don't want to use a module, you don't need to (Although some libraries depend on each
		other, and will be imported whether you like it or not).
